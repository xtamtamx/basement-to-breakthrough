# Basement to Breakthrough - Current Status

## Recently Completed ‚úÖ

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Consolidated Headers**: Single 48px header combining logo, navigation, resources, and next turn button
- **Dynamic UI**: Panels that hide/show based on context to reduce clutter
- **Spacious Show Booking**: 3-step flow (Bands ‚Üí Venue ‚Üí Confirm) with minimal progress dots
- **City View**: Floating controls, collapsible build panel, venue placement mode
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with proper breakpoints

### Core Mechanics
- **Turn Processing**: Shows are executed with detailed results modal
- **Venue Placement**: Click-to-place system on city grid
- **Show Scheduling**: Visual indicators on city view for scheduled shows
- **Economy Balance**: Starting money increased to $500, added 3 new starter venues

## Working Features üéÆ

1. **City Management**
   - 8x8 grid-based city view with districts
   - Venue placement with cost/rent system
   - Walker animations (citizens moving between venues)
   - District stats (gentrification, police presence, scene strength)

2. **Band Management**
   - Band roster system
   - Stats display (popularity, authenticity, energy, technical skill)
   - Traits system
   - Add/remove from roster

3. **Show Booking**
   - Multi-band bills (up to 3 bands)
   - Ticket pricing control
   - Venue availability checking
   - Cost calculations

4. **Turn System**
   - Show execution with attendance calculation
   - Revenue/profit tracking
   - Fan growth
   - Reputation changes

## Known Issues üêõ

1. **Performance**
   - Many ESLint warnings (mostly unused imports)
   - No critical TypeScript errors

2. **Game Balance**
   - Venue costs and returns need tuning
   - Show attendance calculations need refinement
   - Fan growth rates need balancing

## Next Steps üöÄ

### High Priority
1. **Walker System Polish**: Improve animations and pathfinding
2. **Venue Upgrades**: Equipment, capacity expansions, modifiers
3. **Data Persistence**: Save/load game state with IndexedDB
4. **Tutorial**: First-time player onboarding

### Medium Priority
1. **Gentrification System**: District evolution over time
2. **Scene Politics**: Band rivalries, faction relationships
3. **Equipment System**: PA systems, lighting, security
4. **Emergent Events**: Police raids, noise complaints, scene drama

### Low Priority
1. **Artist Integration**: Real band permissions and profiles
2. **Audio System**: Music samples, sound effects
3. **Achievements**: Milestone tracking
4. **Mobile Native**: Capacitor iOS/Android builds

## Technical Debt üîß

1. Clean up unused imports and components
2. Consolidate duplicate UI components
3. Optimize re-renders in city view
4. Add proper error boundaries
5. Implement proper logging system

## Current Game Loop üéØ

1. Start with $500 and basic venues
2. Book shows by selecting bands and venues
3. Set ticket prices to balance attendance vs revenue
4. Execute turn to see show results
5. Grow scene through successful shows
6. Expand with new venues as money allows
7. Build synergies between bands and venues

The core gameplay loop is functional but needs more depth through the planned systems (politics, equipment, gentrification) to create meaningful long-term progression and strategic decisions.
